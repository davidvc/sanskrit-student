# Four Forces Analysis: OCR Translation Feature

The Four Forces framework maps the psychological forces that drive users to adopt (or resist) a new solution.

---

## Job 1: Access Sacred Teachings

### PUSH (Away from current situation)
Forces pushing users to seek a new solution:

- ❌ **Cannot read Devanagari script at all** - Complete barrier to accessing original texts
- ❌ **Wasting hours trying to find transliterations online** - Manual workarounds are time-consuming
- ❌ **Missing out on wisdom** - Cannot access teachings locked behind unfamiliar script
- ❌ **Feeling excluded** - Cannot engage with spiritual communities that share Devanagari content
- ❌ **Dependence on others** - Must ask teachers/scholars for help with every passage

### PULL (Toward new solution)
Forces pulling users toward OCR translation:

- ✅ **Instant access** - Photograph any Sanskrit text and understand it immediately
- ✅ **Confidence in accuracy** - Trust that sacred teachings are correctly translated
- ✅ **Freedom to explore** - No longer limited to pre-translated texts
- ✅ **Empowerment** - Independence in spiritual study, no script barrier
- ✅ **Deeper practice** - Can study original sources, not just secondary translations

### ANXIETY (Fear of new solution)
Forces creating anxiety about adopting OCR:

- ⚠️ **What if OCR makes errors in sacred text?** - Spiritual consequences of misunderstanding
- ⚠️ **What if translation is wrong because OCR misread it?** - Cascading accuracy concerns
- ⚠️ **What if I trust this too much and stop learning?** - Dependency on technology
- ⚠️ **What if technology disrespects sacred texts?** - Reverence vs automation tension
- ⚠️ **What if I miss subtle meanings?** - Automated translation lacks context/nuance

### HABIT (Comfort with current situation)
Forces keeping users in current state:

- 🔄 **I've been managing without OCR** - Finding IAST versions online, asking teachers
- 🔄 **I'm used to asking teachers for help** - Social solution feels more trustworthy
- 🔄 **I have key sutras memorized** - Don't need OCR for familiar passages
- 🔄 **I could just learn Devanagari** - Idealistic aspiration (but haven't actually done it)
- 🔄 **Manual transcription builds familiarity** - Slowness has hidden learning value

---

## Job 2: Trust the Extraction

### PUSH
- ❌ **Cannot visually verify OCR accuracy** - No way to check if extraction is correct
- ❌ **Worried about cascading errors** - OCR mistake → wrong translation → spiritual misunderstanding
- ❌ **No way to know if I should trust result** - Blind faith in black box
- ❌ **Fear of misunderstanding sacred teachings** - High stakes for errors

### PULL
- ✅ **Confidence score** - Clear indicator of OCR quality (90%+ = trustworthy)
- ✅ **Visual comparison** - Side-by-side: original image vs extracted text
- ✅ **Warnings for low quality** - System alerts when OCR confidence is low
- ✅ **Transparency** - Can see exactly what OCR extracted before translation
- ✅ **Actionable guidance** - "Retake with better lighting" (not just "failed")

### ANXIETY
- ⚠️ **What if confidence score is misleading?** - False confidence in bad extraction
- ⚠️ **What if subtle OCR errors slip through?** - 95% confidence but one critical word wrong
- ⚠️ **Will I become too reliant on automation?** - Stop cross-checking with teachers

### HABIT
- 🔄 **I cross-check with multiple sources anyway** - Habit of verification won't change
- 🔄 **I verify important sutras with teacher** - Social verification still valued
- 🔄 **I'm cautious with automated tools** - Healthy skepticism remains

## Job 4: Recover from Upload Issues

### PUSH
- ❌ **Image upload failed** - Now I'm blocked, frustration rising
- ❌ **"Low confidence" warning but no guidance** - Don't know how to fix it
- ❌ **Technical black box** - Tried uploading, nothing happened, no feedback
- ❌ **Frustration interrupting spiritual focus** - Tech problems derailing practice

### PULL
- ✅ **Clear error messages** - Exactly what went wrong (file too large, format unsupported)
- ✅ **Actionable guidance** - "Retake with better lighting" not "OCR failed"
- ✅ **Easy retry** - Fix issue, try again immediately (no starting over)
- ✅ **Confidence I can solve it** - Empowered to fix problem myself

### ANXIETY
- ⚠️ **What if I can't figure out how to fix it?** - Tech anxiety/helplessness
- ⚠️ **What if guidance is too technical?** - Cognitive overload (don't understand OCR jargon)
- ⚠️ **What if I have to understand OCR to use this?** - Barrier to entry

### HABIT
- 🔄 **Tech tools fail, I Google solutions** - Learned helplessness with tech errors
- 🔄 **When tech doesn't "just work," I give up** - Low tolerance for friction
- 🔄 **I could skip this passage** - Avoidance is easier than debugging

## Design Implications

### Reduce ANXIETY (Critical)
1. **Show confidence scores prominently** - Build trust through transparency
2. **Visual comparison side-by-side** - Let users verify extraction even without reading Devanagari
3. **Warn before problems occur** - "Tip: Use bright lighting" upfront
4. **Actionable error messages** - Specific guidance, not generic failures

### Overcome HABIT (Important)
1. **Make OCR dramatically faster than workarounds** - 10x speed advantage
2. **Demonstrate accuracy immediately** - First experience must succeed
3. **Integrate with existing study workflow** - Copy/paste to notes (don't force new habits)

### Amplify PULL (Essential)
1. **Instant gratification** - Photo → translation in under 5 seconds
2. **Empowerment messaging** - "Access any Sanskrit text" not "OCR tool"
3. **Respect sacred context** - Design language reflects reverence for texts
