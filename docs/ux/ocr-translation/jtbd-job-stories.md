- **Functional**: See confidence score, see extracted Devanagari vs original image, understand quality of extraction
- **Emotional**: Feel reassured (not anxious), feel discerning (checked the source), feel safe (not misled)

## Job 3: Mobile Screenshot → Translation (DEFERRED)

**Status:** Out of scope for camera-focused MVP. Will be addressed in future iteration.

## Job 4: Recover from Upload Issues (SECONDARY)

**Job Story:**
> When my upload fails or the image quality produces low confidence, I want clear guidance on how to fix it (retake photo, adjust lighting, crop better), so I can successfully get the translation without technical frustration interrupting my spiritual practice.
