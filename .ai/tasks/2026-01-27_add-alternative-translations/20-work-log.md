## Work Sessions

### Session 1: 2026-01-27 09:50

#### Objectives for This Session
```
✓ Add alternativeTranslations field to TypeScript types
✓ Update GraphQL schema to expose alternative translations
✓ Write TDD tests for alternative translations
✓ Update mock LLM client with alternative translation data
✓ Update Claude LLM client prompt and parsing
✓ Verify all tests pass
```

#### Work Completed
```
✓ Updated TranslationResult interface to include alternativeTranslations field
✓ Updated GraphQL schema with alternativeTranslations field
✓ Updated TRANSLATE_SUTRA_QUERY to request alternativeTranslations
✓ Created comprehensive test suite (alternative-translations.test.ts)
✓ Updated LlmTranslationResponse interface
✓ Updated mock LLM client with alternative translation data
✓ Updated Claude LLM client prompt to request alternatives
✓ Updated Claude LLM client parsing logic
✓ Updated LlmTranslationService to pass through alternatives
✓ All 30 tests passing
✓ TypeScript compilation successful
```

**Files Modified:**
- `src/domain/types.ts` - Added alternativeTranslations field to TranslationResult
- `src/domain/llm-client.ts` - Added alternativeTranslations field to LlmTranslationResponse
- `src/server.ts` - Updated GraphQL schema with alternativeTranslations field
- `src/adapters/mock-llm-client.ts` - Added alternative translations to stubbed data
- `src/adapters/llm-translation-service.ts` - Pass through alternativeTranslations from LLM
- `src/adapters/claude-llm-client.ts` - Added extraction logic for alternativeTranslations
- `prompts/sanskrit-translation.txt` - Updated prompt to request up to 3 alternatives
- `tests/helpers/graphql-queries.ts` - Updated query to include alternativeTranslations
- `tests/acceptance/alternative-translations.test.ts` - NEW comprehensive test suite

**Tests Added/Modified:**
- `tests/acceptance/alternative-translations.test.ts` - New file with 3 comprehensive tests:
  1. Validates alternative sutra translations (1-3 alternatives)
  2. Validates up to 3 alternative meanings per word
  3. Validates alternatives are distinct (not duplicates)

**Commands Run:**
```bash
npm test -- tests/acceptance/alternative-translations.test.ts  # Result: 3/3 passing (TDD RED → GREEN)
npm test                                                       # Result: 30/30 passing
npx tsc --noEmit                                              # Result: Success, no errors
```

#### In Progress
```
None - Implementation complete
```

#### Decisions Made
```
1. Made alternativeTranslations optional (alternativeTranslations?: string[])
   Rationale: Backward compatibility, LLM may not always provide alternatives

2. Used existing WordEntry.meanings[] array for word alternatives
   Rationale: Already supports multiple meanings, no schema change needed

3. Requested up to 3 alternatives in prompt
   Rationale: Balances variety with response size and cost

4. Updated both mock and Claude clients
   Rationale: Ensures tests work without external dependencies

5. Made alternativeTranslations nullable in GraphQL schema
   Rationale: Optional field allows graceful degradation
```

#### Issues Encountered
```
Issue: Initial test run failed with npm dependencies
- Attempted: Running tests directly
- Resolution: Ran `npm install` then tests passed
```

#### Blockers
```
None
```

#### Next Steps
```
✓ Implementation complete
✓ All tests passing
□ Ready for Tester validation
□ Ready for Reviewer validation
```

## Deviations from Plan

### Changes to Original Plan
```
None - Implementation followed contract exactly
```

### Impact Assessment
```
- Timeline impact: None (completed in single session)
- Scope impact: None (met all requirements)
- Quality impact: Improved (comprehensive test coverage)
```

---

## Test Results

### Test Execution Summary
```
Total Tests: 30
Passing: 30
Failing: 0
Skipped: 0

New Tests Added: 3
- Alternative sutra translations validation
- Alternative word meanings validation (up to 3)
- Distinct alternatives validation
```

### Test Failures (if any)
```
None - All tests passing
```

---

## Code Quality Metrics

### Linting Results
```
Not explicitly run (TypeScript compilation checks basic quality)
```

### Build Results
```
Build status: Success
TypeScript compilation: Success (tsc --noEmit)
Compilation warnings: 0
```

### Performance Metrics
```
Tests execution time: ~1.9s (acceptable)
All existing tests continue to pass (backward compatible)
```

---

## Technical Debt Identified

### New Technical Debt
```
None identified
```

### Addressed Technical Debt
```
None applicable (new feature, no existing debt)
```

---

## Learnings and Insights

### What Went Well
```
✓ TDD approach worked perfectly (RED → GREEN)
✓ Existing WordEntry.meanings[] array already supported multiple values
✓ Optional field approach maintains backward compatibility
✓ Mock client allows testing without LLM dependencies
✓ Single session implementation (efficient)
```

### What Could Be Improved
```
None identified - straightforward feature implementation
```

### Knowledge Gained
```
- Confirmed GraphQL optional fields use nullable syntax
- Verified prompt structure for requesting LLM alternatives
- Learned Beads task management commands (bd create, bd update)
```

### Surprises and Discoveries
```
- WordEntry already had meanings[] array - minimal changes needed
- All existing tests passed immediately (good backward compatibility)
- TypeScript inference handled optional field gracefully
```
