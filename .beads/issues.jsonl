For example:\n\n   For AC1 (first criterion):\n   TaskCreate(\n     subject=\"RED-GREEN-REFACTOR: AC1 - [description]\",\n     description='''Execute complete TDD cycle for acceptance criterion 1.\n\n     CONTEXT:\n     - Feature: Basic translation frontend\n     - Acceptance Criterion: AC1 from acceptance-criteria.md\n     - This is the FIRST AC - no dependencies\n\n     RED PHASE:\n     1. Read acceptance criteria for AC1\n     2. Write acceptance test FIRST (in acceptance/ directory)\n     3. Use mocks for external dependencies (e.g., MockOcrEngine)\n     4. Run test → Verify it FAILS (red)\n     5. Commit: \"RED: AC1 - [description]\"\n\n     GREEN PHASE:\n     1. Write minimal code to make test pass\n     2. Run test → Verify it PASSES (green)\n     3. Commit: \"GREEN: AC1 - [description]\"\n\n     REFACTOR PHASE:\n     1. Use /ocr-review command to review this branch against main\n     2. Refactor to fix issues\n     3. Run test → Verify STILL PASSES\n     4. Commit: \"REFACTOR: AC1 - [description]\"\n\n     COMPLETION:\n     - Mark task as completed when all three phases done\n     - All tests passing\n     ''',\n     activeForm=\"Implementing AC1 with RED-GREEN-REFACTOR\"\n   )\n\n   For AC2 (second criterion):\n   TaskCreate(\n     subject=\"RED-GREEN-REFACTOR: AC2 - [description]\",\n     description='''Execute complete TDD cycle for acceptance criterion 2.\n\n     CONTEXT:\n     - Feature: Basic translation frontend\n     - Acceptance Criterion: AC2 from acceptance-criteria.md\n     - DEPENDS ON: AC1 must be complete (builds on AC1's code)\n\n     [Same RED-GREEN-REFACTOR workflow as AC1]\n     ''',\n     activeForm=\"Implementing AC2 with RED-GREEN-REFACTOR\"\n   )\n\n   Then use TaskUpdate to set dependency:\n   TaskUpdate(taskId=\"AC2-task-id\", addBlockedBy=[\"AC1-task-id\"])\n\n   REPEAT for AC3, AC4, etc. - each blocked by the previous AC\n\n4. Spawn teammates to work on tasks:\n\n   Spawn 1-2 engineer teammates using Task tool:\n   Task(\n     subagent_type=\"general-purpose\",\n     team_name=\"basic-translation-frontend-tdd\",\n     name=\"tdd-engineer-1\",\n     prompt='''You are a TDD engineer on the basic-translation-frontend-tdd team.\n\n     WORKFLOW:\n     1. Check TaskList to find available tasks (not blocked)\n     2. Claim the next available task (lowest ID first)\n     3. Execute the RED-GREEN-REFACTOR cycle as described\n     4. Mark task completed when done\n     5. Check TaskList for next task\n     6. Repeat until all tasks complete\n\n     CRITICAL RULES:\n     - NEVER write production code without failing test first\n     - Each phase = separate git commit\n     - Tests must pass before marking task complete\n     - Follow clean code principles\n     - Sequential execution - tasks have dependencies\n     '''\n   )\n\nMONITORING:\n-----------\nWhile teammates work:\n1. Monitor task progress using TaskList\n2. Teammates will automatically work through tasks sequentially\n3. Each AC builds on previous AC's code\n4. No approval needed between ACs\n\nCOMPLETION:\n-----------\nWhen all AC tasks are completed:\n\n1. Verify all tests pass:\n   - Run full test suite\n   - Confirm no regressions\n\n2. Make sure all changes are committed and the worktree branch is in sync with main. Resolve any merge conflicts\n\n3. Shutdown teammates:\n   SendMessage(\n     type=\"shutdown_request\",\n     recipient=\"tdd-engineer-1\",\n     content=\"All ACs complete, shutting down\"\n   )\n\n4. Delete team:\n   TeamDelete()\n\n5. Mark this task complete\n\nKEY REQUIREMENTS:\n-----------------\n- Use Claude tasks (TaskCreate/TaskUpdate/TaskList) NOT subagents for ACs\n- Use TeamCreate and teammates for implementation\n- Sequential execution via task dependencies (blockedBy)\n- Each AC = one complete RED-GREEN-REFACTOR cycle\n- Each AC builds on previous AC's code\n- No approval between ACs - fully automated","status":"in_progress","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2026-02-01T18:33:05.52798-08:00","updated_at":"2026-02-06T19:26:04.294072-08:00","dependencies":[{"issue_id":"ss-mol-8z2","depends_on_id":"ss-mol-coh","type":"parent-child","created_at":"2026-02-01T18:33:05.531991-08:00","created_by":"dvancouvering"},{"issue_id":"ss-mol-8z2","depends_on_id":"ss-mol-ijo","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-02-01T18:33:05.536531-08:00","created_by":"dvancouvering"},{"issue_id":"ss-mol-8z2","depends_on_id":"ss-mol-coh.2","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-02-01T19:03:51.718823-08:00","created_by":"dvancouvering"}]}

This makes it harder for clients to display the text line-by-line without additional parsing.\n\n## Current Behavior\n- `originalText`: `\"असतो मा सद्गमय\\nतमसो मा ज्योतिर्गमय\"` (single string with `\\n`)\n- `iastText`: `\"asato mā sadgamaya\\ntamaso mā jyotirgamaya\"` (single string with `\\n`)\n\n## Desired Behavior\n- `originalText`: `[\"असतो मा सद्गमय\", \"तमसो मा ज्योतिर्गमय\"]` (array of strings, one per line)\n- `iastText`: `[\"asato mā sadgamaya\", \"tamaso mā jyotirgamaya\"]` (array of strings, one per line)\n\n---\n\n## AC1: Single-line text returns single-element arrays\n**Given** a user submits single-line text (no newlines)  \n**When** the translation completes  \n**Then** `originalText` should be an array with one element containing the text  \n**And** `iastText` should be an array with one element containing the text  \n\n**Example:**\n- Input: `\"atha yoganusasanam\"`\n- `originalText`: `[\"atha yoganusasanam\"]`\n- `iastText`: `[\"atha yoganusasanam\"]`\n\n---\n\n## AC2: Multi-line text returns multi-element arrays\n**Given** a user submits multi-line text (with newlines)  \n**When** the translation completes  \n**Then** `originalText` should be an array with one element per line  \n**And** `iastText` should be an array with one element per line  \n**And** each array should have the same number of elements  \n\n**Example:**\n- Input (Devanagari): `\"असतो मा सद्गमय\\nतमसो मा ज्योतिर्गमय\"`\n- `originalText`: `[\"असतो मा सद्गमय\", \"तमसो मा ज्योतिर्गमय\"]`\n- `iastText`: `[\"asato mā sadgamaya\", \"tamaso mā jyotirgamaya\"]`\n\n---\n\n## AC3: Empty lines are preserved in the arrays\n**Given** a user submits text with empty lines  \n**When** the translation completes  \n**Then** `originalText` should include empty strings for empty lines  \n**And** `iastText` should include empty strings for empty lines  \n\n**Example:**\n- Input: `\"line1\\n\\nline3\"`\n- `originalText`: `[\"line1\", \"\", \"line3\"]`\n- `iastText`: `[\"line1\", \"\", \"line3\"]`\n\n---\n\n## AC4: OCR translation preserves multi-line structure\n**Given** a user uploads an image with multi-line Devanagari text  \n**When** the OCR translation completes  \n**Then** `extractedText` should remain as a string with `\\n` (no change to this field)  \n**And** `originalText` should be an array with one element per line  \n**And** `iastText` should be an array with one element per line  \n\n**Example (from AC11 test):**\n- OCR `extractedText`: `\"असतो मा सद्गमय\\nतमसो मा ज्योतिर्गमय\"` (unchanged, still a string)\n- `originalText`: `[\"असतो मा सद्गमय\", \"तमसो मा ज्योतिर्गमय\"]` (array)\n- `iastText`: `[\"asato mā sadgamaya\", \"tamaso mā jyotirgamaya\"]` (array)\n\n---\n\n## AC5: GraphQL schema reflects the new array types\n**Given** the GraphQL schema is updated  \n**When** a client queries the schema  \n**Then** `originalText` should be typed as `[String!]!`  \n**And** `iastText` should be typed as `[String!]!`  \n**And** the schema should validate that arrays are non-null and contain non-null strings  \n\n---\n\n## AC6: All existing tests pass with updated implementation\n**Given** all existing acceptance and unit tests are updated  \n**When** the test suite runs  \n**Then** all tests should pass  \n**And** no regressions should be introduced  \n\n---\n\n## AC7: Backward compatibility is NOT maintained\n**Note:** This is a BREAKING change to the API contract.  \n- Clients currently expecting `originalText` and `iastText` as strings will need to update.  \n- This is acceptable for this internal project.  \n- Documentation should clearly note the change.\n\n---\n\n## Success Criteria Summary\n1. ✅ Single-line text returns arrays with one element\n2. ✅ Multi-line text returns arrays with one element per line\n3. ✅ Empty lines are preserved as empty strings in arrays\n4. ✅ OCR `extractedText` remains unchanged (string with `\\n`)\n5. ✅ GraphQL schema updated to `[String!]!` for both fields\n6. ✅ All tests pass (acceptance + unit)\n7. ✅ Documentation updated to reflect breaking change","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2026-01-29T19:44:02.319-08:00","updated_at":"2026-01-29T20:13:34.287479-08:00","closed_at":"2026-01-29T20:13:34.287484-08:00","dependencies":[{"issue_id":"ss-mol-tev","depends_on_id":"ss-mol-v41","type":"parent-child","created_at":"2026-01-29T19:44:02.320645-08:00","created_by":"dvancouvering"}]}
