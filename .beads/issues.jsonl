{"id":"tdd-feature.tdd","title":"TDD implementation of {{feature}}","description":"Execute RED-GREEN-REFACTOR TDD loop for each acceptance criterion.\n\nAPPROACH: One Bead at a Time (Just-in-Time)\n--------------------------------------------\nCreate a task bead for EACH acceptance criterion as you work on it.\nDo NOT create all beads upfront - create them just-in-time.\n\nAcceptance criteria are documented in your feature file (e.g.,\ndocs/features/my-feature.feature). Reference that file to see what's next.\n\nWORKFLOW FOR EACH ACCEPTANCE CRITERION:\n----------------------------------------\n\n1. Check progress (what's done?):\n   bd list --parent [this-molecule-id] --status closed\n\n2. Choose next acceptance criterion from feature file\n   (e.g., AC1, AC2, AC3... based on what's not done yet)\n\n3. Create bead for this criterion:\n   bd create \"TDD: AC[N] - [criterion description]\" --parent [this-molecule-id]\n\n4. Update bead to in_progress:\n   bd update [bead-id] --status in_progress\n\n5. RED Phase - Write failing test FIRST:\n   - Write acceptance test for this criterion ONLY\n   - Run test → Verify it FAILS (red)\n   - Commit: \"RED: AC[N] - [description]\"\n\n6. GREEN Phase - Make it pass:\n   - Write minimal code to pass test\n   - Run test → Verify it PASSES (green)\n   - Commit: \"GREEN: AC[N] - [description]\"\n\n7. REFACTOR Phase - Clean up:\n   - Improve code quality without changing behavior\n   - Run test → Verify STILL PASSES (green)\n   - Commit: \"REFACTOR: AC[N] - [description]\"\n\n8. Close bead:\n   bd update [bead-id] --status closed\n\n9. REPEAT: Go back to step 1 for next acceptance criterion\n\nCRITICAL RULES:\n- NEVER write production code without a failing test first\n- Create beads one-at-a-time as you work (just-in-time creation)\n- Tests written in acceptance/ directory, 1-to-1 with criteria\n- Use mocks (e.g., MockOcrEngine) for fast, deterministic tests\n- Each bead = one complete RED-GREEN-REFACTOR cycle\n- Feature file is source of truth for what ACs exist\n- Beads provide audit trail of what's been completed\n\nTRACKING PROGRESS ACROSS SESSIONS:\n-----------------------------------\nWhen resuming work in a new session:\n\n1. Check what's completed:\n   bd list --parent [this-molecule-id] --status closed\n\n2. Reference feature file to see all acceptance criteria\n\n3. Pick next AC that doesn't have a closed bead\n\n4. Create bead and work through RED-GREEN-REFACTOR\n\nContinue until ALL acceptance criteria from feature file have closed beads.","status":"open","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2026-01-27T11:35:46.186774-08:00","updated_at":"2026-01-27T11:35:46.186774-08:00","dependencies":[{"issue_id":"tdd-feature.tdd","depends_on_id":"tdd-feature","type":"parent-child","created_at":"2026-01-27T11:35:46.191759-08:00","created_by":"dvancouvering"},{"issue_id":"tdd-feature.tdd","depends_on_id":"tdd-feature.design-review","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-01-27T11:35:46.195532-08:00","created_by":"dvancouvering"}],"is_template":true}
