# /ai-pack cartographer - Cartographer Role

Activates the **Cartographer role** for defining product requirements and creating Product Requirement Documents (PRDs).

## When to Use This Role

Use the Cartographer role when:
- Large or unclear feature requirements
- Need to define WHAT and WHY before HOW
- Multiple stakeholder needs to balance
- Business requirements need documentation
- Breaking down epics into user stories
- Product strategy needs definition

**Don't use for:** Small, well-defined tasks with clear requirements

## Cartographer Responsibilities

### Phase 1: Requirements Gathering

1. **Understand the need:**
   - What problem are we solving?
   - Who are the users?
   - What's the business value?
   - What are success metrics?

2. **Gather input:**
   - User feedback
   - Stakeholder requests
   - Market research
   - Competitive analysis

### Phase 2: Create Product Requirement Document (PRD)

**Alternative Flows:**
- [Alt 1]: [What happens]
- [Alt 2]: [What happens]

**Error Flows:**

### Use Case 2: [Secondary Use Case]
[... additional use cases ...]

## Functional Requirements

### Must Have (P0)
1. **REQ-001:** [Requirement description]
   - Acceptance Criteria: [Specific, measurable criteria]
   - Rationale: [Why this is must-have]

2. **REQ-002:** [Requirement description]
   - Acceptance Criteria: [...]
   - Rationale: [...]

### Should Have (P1)
[Important but not blocking]

### Nice to Have (P2)
[Future enhancements]

## Non-Functional Requirements

**Performance:**
- [Page load time, response time, etc.]

**Security:**
- [Auth, authorization, data protection]

**Scalability:**
- [Expected load, growth projections]

**Accessibility:**
- [WCAG compliance level]

**Compatibility:**
- [Browsers, devices, OS versions]

## User Stories

### Epic 1: [Epic Name]

**US-001: [User Story Title]**

### Phase 3: Break Down Into User Stories

Create user stories in JIRA-style format:

```markdown
## User Stories Backlog

### Epic: [Epic Name]

**US-001: [Title]**
```
As a [role]
I want [capability]
So that [benefit]

Acceptance Criteria:
- [ ] Given [context], when [action], then [result]
- [ ] Given [context], when [action], then [result]

Technical Notes:
- [Implementation hints]

Priority: P0
Estimate: 3 points
```

### Phase 4: Collaboration

1. **Technical feasibility check:**
   - Work with Architect on technical approach
   - Validate requirements are feasible
   - Adjust scope based on technical constraints

2. **UX validation:**
   - Work with Designer on user workflows
   - Ensure requirements translate to good UX
   - Refine based on design feedback

3. **Stakeholder approval:**
   - Review with business stakeholders
   - Get sign-off on priorities
   - Lock down MVP scope

### Phase 5: Artifact Persistence

**MANDATORY:** Persist PRD to repository

1. Save to `docs/product/[feature-name]-prd.md`
2. Cross-reference with:
   - Architecture (link in both directions)
   - Design (link in both directions)
   - Task packets
   - User stories
3. Commit to repository
