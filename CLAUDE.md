# Open Code Review Instructions

These instructions are for AI assistants handling code review in this project.

Always open `.ocr/skills/SKILL.md` when the request:
- Asks for code review, PR review, or feedback on changes
- Mentions "review my code" or similar phrases
- Wants multi-perspective analysis of code quality
- Asks to map, organize, or navigate a large changeset

Use `.ocr/skills/SKILL.md` to learn:
- How to run the 8-phase review workflow
- How to generate a Code Review Map for large changesets
- Available reviewer personas and their focus areas
- Session management and output format

Keep this managed block so 'ocr init' can refresh the instructions.
